# Data Mining & Simulation Methods Tutorial

This is an educational website that explains various data mining and simulation methods with interactive examples. The site covers:

- Apriori Algorithm for Association Rules
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- K-means Clustering
- Decision Trees

Each method includes an interactive example that demonstrates how the algorithm works.

## How to Deploy

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `yourusername.github.io` (replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username)
2. Initialize this folder as a git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
3. Add your GitHub repository as remote and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Go to your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to "Pages" and select the "main" branch as the source

Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io` after a few minutes!
